# Frequently Asked Questions
1. **How should I prepare a file for submission?**  
   To prepare a file for submission;
   - Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AI-Lab-Makerere/CV4Agriculture_Hackathon24/blob/main/guides/Submissions.md) and ensure that the
   file has been formatted correctly for the correct task.
   - Ensure that the CSV file is named correctly. The CSV filename is the name of your team e.g. if the team is called `Apocalypto`, then the CSV file
     must be named `Apocalyto.csv`. Also please note that this is case sensitive and that files named with an unknown filename will be rejected on the
     submission platform.
   - Upload the correctly formated and named CSV file to the right link for [Maize Classfication](http://104.154.155.23/eval/maize_class/) or for [Cocoa
     Detection](http://104.154.155.23/eval/cocoa_det/)
2. **What are some of the common issues with a submission?**
     - Inconsistent column names - Ensure that the columns are named exactly the way they have been shown in the [submission guidelines](https://github.com/AI-Lab-Makerere/CV4Agriculture_Hackathon24/blob/main/guides/Submissions.md)
     - Missing columns - Ensure that you have submiited a complete file with all the columns. For the Maize Classfication Challenge there should be a prediction
       for every file in the test set.
     - Incorrect data types - Use the correct datatype for the predicted values and ensure that there are no empty values.
