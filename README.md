# CV4Agriculture_Hackathon24
This repository contains resources for the [Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://air.ug/) Computer Vision for agriculture Hackathon.  
The Hackathon is running from  20th April to 18th May 2024.  
The competition will focus on building computer vision models for the classfication of diseases in maize leaf images and different objects of interest in the Cocoa tree images.  
Through this, university students will gain experience in building solutions for deployment in the field.
## The problem
The task is to develop 2 computer vision models for a classfication and object detection task.

### Maize Disease Classification
For classfication, participants will develop models to predict if a maize leaf image is diseased or healthy. The diseased leaves have been split into 4 distinct disease classes:
  1. FAW -  Images show leaves that have suffered [fallarmy worm damage](https://agriculture.go.ug/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FAW-Brochure_MAAIF_DCP_revised_April_2018.pdf).
  2. MLB -  Images show leaves affected by [Maize Leaf Blight](https://lfl.bayern.de/ips/blattfruechte/050760/index.php#:~:text=First%20symptoms%20on%20maize%20plants,green%20to%20light%20brown%20lesions.)
  3. MLN -  Images show leaves affected by [Maize Lethal Necrosis](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.119663)
  4. MSV - Images show leaves affected by [Maize Streak Virus](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/cabicompendium.32620)

### Cocoa Object Detection
For the object detection task, participants will develop models to detect various stages of the cocoa fruit in the coccoa tree images:
  1. Mature_Unripe - Images with mature but not yet ripe cocoa pods
  2. Immature - Images with Cocoa pods that are still growing.
  3. Ripped - Images with ripe mature cocoa pods.
  4. Spoilt - Images with Spoilt cocoa pods.
